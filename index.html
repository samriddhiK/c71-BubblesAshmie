The seats are well-cushioned and quite comfortable. The stage has plenty of space for performances, and the lighting system is also very good. </p>

  <h4>New School Canteen</h4>
  <img src="canteen.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12>
  <p class= "list-group-item list-group-item-success col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider, canteens must be better organized and more efficient than they have been in the past. Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared and detailed descriptions of their ingedients help both students and parents make the right nutrional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they might have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the tuss of handling money, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

  <p class= "list-group-item list-group-item-success col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. ACCURACY
    Humans are prone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance mamagement systems ensure accurate time records and minimize the invetitable and costly errors with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data, so we have an automated BeeBot counting the number of students as they walk by. This BeeBot is based on the human body, so it has a head, arms, legs, hands, fingers, toes, stomach, chest, face, etc. But, unlike a human, this robot needs electrical charge to operate, and the money we spend on the electricity this bot uses is sent to charity groups around the world.
